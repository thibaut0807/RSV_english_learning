      <p><strong>Using AI to talk to the deceased</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the age of technological advancements, artificial intelligence (AI) has found its way into almost every aspect of our lives. One of the more controversial and emotional uses is employing AI to simulate conversations with those who have passed away. While this idea may seem like a breakthrough for coping with loss, its application raises serious ethical questions and may even affect the natural healing process.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI chatbots and virtual avatars are created using a deceased person’s digital footprint—social media posts, text messages, and emails. This can lead to highly realistic interactions that mimic past conversations. However, this realism can be deceptive: it cannot recreate the genuine thoughts or emotions of the deceased, and some experts argue that such interactions may hinder acceptance and prolong grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another major concern involves privacy and consent. If a person never explicitly agreed to have their digital information used after death, generating AI versions of them might violate their rights. Moreover, companies could exploit vulnerable individuals, turning grief into a profitable business while disregarding long-term psychological consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        While some users report temporary comfort or a sense of closure, overreliance on AI may trap them in artificial relationships rather than helping them process their loss and move forward.
